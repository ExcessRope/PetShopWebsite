# PetShopWebsite
Simple Website for imaginary Pet Store as part of Web Programming practice. 
Utilizes C#, HTML5, ASP.NET, CSS, Javascript, SQL, XML, JQuery. 
I learned a lot from this project. It spanned several weeks and I had a lot of freedom to implement things as I liked. 
It's certainly not perfect, but it was a great chance to practice and apply a lot of different skills and tools.
